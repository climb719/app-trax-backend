## Job Application Tracker

Graduates from Flatiron will apply for hundreds of jobs, so it’s difficult to keep application info organized and track updates. 

### User Story:
 - A user is able to add new company’s they have applied to (with date, status, and notes).
 - A user is able to view all their application info in organized cards. 
 - A user is able to update application status and delete an entire application card
        -- Stretch goal: reminders to follow-up after 1 week
